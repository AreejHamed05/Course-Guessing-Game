# 🧠 Course Guessing Game

An interactive terminal-based guessing game built in C. The program guesses academic courses by asking a series of yes/no questions using a **binary decision tree**. If the program guesses wrong, it learns by prompting the user for a new course and a question—then updates its tree structure.

---

## 🎮 How It Works

1. The game starts with a single question and two possible courses.
2. As the user plays, it asks yes/no questions and traverses the tree.
3. If it guesses incorrectly, the user teaches it the correct course and a new question.
4. The game **saves progress** using file I/O (serialization and deserialization).
5. Every time the program runs, it reloads the saved tree and continues learning!

## 🧠 My Role

- Built and managed the binary tree using C structures and pointers
- Handled recursive traversal and memory management
- Implemented file saving and loading logic
- Designed the learning interaction and decision update flow
- Debugged and optimized tree growth logic
